## üí° What's New

We released [Ever Gauzy Teams](https://github.com/ever-co/ever-gauzy-teams) platform for Work & Project Management.  
Please check <https://github.com/ever-co/ever-gauzy-teams> and make it ‚≠ê on GitHub!  
It's built with React / ReactNative stack and connects to headless [Ever Gauzy Platform](https://github.com/ever-co/ever-gauzy) APIs.

## üåü What is it

[Ever¬Æ Traduora](https://traduora.co) - **Open Translation Management Platform** for teams. 

Once you setup your project you can import and export your translations to various formats, work together with your team, instantly deliver translation updates over the air, and *soon* automatically translate your project via third-party integrations.

We want Traduora to become the home for managing your translation workflow, that's why we have made all of the core products **open-source** with the intention of growing a **community** and enabling developers to build on top of it as a platform. 

We are going to also use Traduora from our other open-source platforms (currently https://github.com/ever-co/ever-gauzy and https://github.com/ever-co/ever-demand). You are welcome to check more information about the platforms at our official website - https://ever.co.

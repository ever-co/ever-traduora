### Before submitting the PR, please make sure you do the following

 1. Contributor license agreement
For us it's important to have the agreement of our contributors to use their work, whether it be code or documentation. Therefore, we are asking all contributors to sign a contributor license agreement (CLA) as commonly accepted in most open source projects. **Just open the pull request and our CLA bot will prompt you briefly.**

 2. Please check our [contribution guidelines](https://docs.traduora.co/docs/contributing#review-process-for-this-repo) for some help in the process.
